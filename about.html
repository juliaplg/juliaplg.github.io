                Hrm... so what do I like? Oh, I know! Petpets! The cuter the better. Xweetoks are well known for
    
                taking great care of their Petpets. I often read the books <b>naftalina25</b> gives me aloud to them before
                I
    
                go to sleep. It helps me learn better, and even though I know they can't understand it, I think they like
    
                the soothing sound of my voice.</b>
